#### Encrypting-Decryption-keys
This project is part of the Google IT professional certificate. 

### Introduction
OpenSSL is a commercial-grade utility toolkit for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols. It’s also a general-purpose cryptography library. OpenSSL is licensed under an Apache-style license, which means that you’re free to get it and use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes (subject to some simple license conditions).

### Project details
In this lab, I learned how to generate RSA private and public key pairs using the OpenSSL utility.
